Recent outcome-based reinforcement learning methods have improved the training of large language models (LLMs) for reasoning tasks, but many policy optimization schemes remain reliant on sparse terminal rewards and are prone to entropy collapse, which reduces output diversity. We introduce **GIPO (Group Information Policy Optimizer)**, a novel reinforcement learning framework built upon the **Information Bottleneck**, to address these limitations. This approach promotes principled, diverse exploration while encouraging the model to learn compact and informative internal representations.

This capability relies on two key innovations:
1.  **A group-sequential entropy regularizer** that introduces a progressive entropy constraint applied to intermediate reasoning steps. This prevents premature entropy collapse while allowing sufficient diversity early in the generation process.
2.  **A confidence-guided implicit reward** derived from information-bottleneck principles. This reward encourages the model to produce compressed, informative internal states that are predictive of eventual successful outcomes, moving beyond a sole reliance on sparse terminal rewards.

Empirical results across multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that GIPO improves reasoning quality, sample efficiency, and generation diversity compared to strong outcome-based RL baselines, especially under constrained token budgets.

## Introduction

Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language understanding and generation, achieving state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of tasks. However, despite these advances, LLMs still struggle with multi-step reasoning and complex problem solving that require deliberate planning, hypothesis testing, and diverse solution generation.

Pretraining with next-token prediction provides LLMs with rich linguistic and factual priors, but it does not explicitly teach models how to perform multi-step reasoning or how to evaluate intermediate computational states. Supervised fine-tuning on curated datasets can improve task performance but often reduces generalization and limits creative problem solving. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) aligns models to human preferences, yet it typically depends on sparse, noisy, or delayed reward signals and may not sufficiently promote structured, deliberative reasoning.

Recent outcome-based RL approaches scale RL to LLMs by assigning rewards to final answers (terminal outcomes) rather than to the intermediate chain-of-thought (CoT) steps. While this strategy simplifies reward design and can improve single-solution accuracy (e.g., pass@1), it often fails to increase the model's ability to generate a diverse set of valid solutions and can cause entropy collapse during training. Entropy collapse reduces the model's exploratory behavior, leading to mode-seeking that harms robustness and downstream generalization.

## Our Contributions

-   We introduce a group-sequential entropy regularizer tailored to multi-step sequence generation that mitigates entropy collapse without sacrificing early-stage exploration.
-   We derive a confidence-guided implicit reward from information-bottleneck objectives and show how to integrate it with standard policy optimization.
-   We provide empirical evidence that combining these ideas (GIPO) improves reasoning quality, diversity, and stability in LLM reinforcement learning.
